# Simple Course Management System
This is a Python database application that can add a new student to its database, allow user to add
courses they wish to read and also students or those already in the database can also login add more 
courses or drop courses and also print out all the information of the students including all the 
courses he/she is currently enrolled in plus the total cost of all the courses enrolled in.

## Database
The database used in this application is an open source lightweight relational database called " SQLite3 ".

By default Pyhton3 comes with SQLite3 and since I used  Python3 in my production no extra setup is needed.
Also there is no need to manually craete any databases or table(s) all will be taken care by the program.

But to view the data in the database after executing it, you will need to download and install
" DB Browser for SQLite ". 
Download link: http://sqlitebrowser.org/

## Running the Application

To check wheteher you have python installed, Type the command: python
in your command prompt or terminal.You will see a result like this if you have python installed

If Python is not installed or python version is less than 3.5, then you have to install the lastest python.
